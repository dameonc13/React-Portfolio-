              My name is Dameon Charley I graduated from Southern Connecticut
              State University with a bachelor degree in Accounting and a minor
              in Computer Science. My background is diverse having worked across
              different aspects of business from Accounting to Finance and Sales
              <br />

              I got into programming thanks to a recommendation from a friend
              and I have loved it ever since. I first added a computer science
              minor during my undergrad but wanted to purse a career and gain a
              better understanding of programming. This was the reason I choose
              to enroll in BootCamp at University oF Connecticut for Full Stack
              Web Development .

              As the two earths collide the sun glares blinds the window the
              heat from his mouth burns into his coffee. If They could walk
              where would they sing if they could listen where would they walk
              if they didn't bark would they be loved. Don't let the greens fool
              you for the deception of man is bewildering.
