            My name is Dameon Charley I graduated from Southern Connecticut
            State University with a bachelor degree in Accounting and minor in
            Computer Science. I have grown a love coding and that's why I am
            currently enrolled in BootCamp at University oF Connecticut for Web
            Design.
            <br />

            I enjoy a good sunny day in the cold winter time that is dry and
            humid but is also freezing drinking a large coffee in a small cup
            tea with chilled ice. Staring in the clouds my pillows so fresh so
            clean. Chilling with my pet fly he so greedy always tasting my food.
          </p>
          <p>
            He disappear every winter and reappear every spring like a true
            father he is. The blues of the waters flows under my feet as i walk
            with my head down in the ground.
          </p>

            As the two earths collide the sun glares blinds the window the heat
            from his mouth burns into his coffee. If They could walk where would
            they sing if they could listen where would they walk if they didn't
            bark would they be loved. Don't let the greens fool you for the
            deception of man is bewildering.
